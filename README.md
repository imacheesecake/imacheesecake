# 👋 Hi there, I'm imacheesecake

I'm a developer with a background in **Information Systems and Technology (B.S.)** and a strong interest in both **web development** and **cybersecurity**.

I enjoy building clean, functional applications with real-world use — such as booking systems, order platforms, and digital tools that simplify user workflows. I also explore networking and security through hands-on labs and scripting in tools like Nmap, Kali Linux, and Windows-based test environments.
